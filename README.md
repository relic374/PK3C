# PK3C
Converts an inputted folder into a just .pk3 or a .pk3 & a .zip<br>
This is a terminal application btw

<hr>

Download pk3c.zip and unzip it<br>
go into your terminal and run ./install.sh<br>
you might be prompted to enter your password, and if so enter it<br>
once the installation finishes, you'll have to put 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/pk3c' into line 1 of your shell rc file (.zshrc, .bashrc, etc)<br>
then if should work!<br>
to run it, just type in 'pk3c.sh' anywhere in the terminal!<br>
