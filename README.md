# PK3C
Converts an inputted folder into a just .pk3 or a .pk3 & a .zip
This is a terminal application btw


Download pk3c.zip and unzip it
go into your terminal and run ./install.sh
you might be prompted to enter your password, and if so enter it
once the installation finishes, you'll have to put 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/pk3c' into line 1 of your shell rc file (.zshrc, .bashrc, etc)
then if should work! 
to run it, just type in 'pk3c.sh' anywhere in the terminal!
